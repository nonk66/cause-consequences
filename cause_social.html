        <p>Mennonites had been coming to Canada since the Cariboo Gold Rush for various reasons</p>
        <p>|<br>|<br>V</p>
        <p>Many were looking to leave their homeland for reasons such as discrimination, new mandatory conscription, and land shortage</p>
        <p>|<br>|<br>V</p>
        <p>The draws of Canada included gold during the gold rush, but also just being generally welcoming to foreigners (with exceptions)</p>
        <p>|<br>|<br>V</p>
        <p>Though Mennonites' status as preferred immigrants fluctuated, Canada was overall a good place for them, especially since the US barred them at the time</p>
        <p>|<br>|<br>V</p>
        <p>Those that went with the retreating German army were the third large wave of Mennonite immigrants, the first being in the 1870s and the second during the Russian Civil War</p>
