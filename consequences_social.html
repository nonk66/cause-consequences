    <h1>Consequences - Social</h1>
    <div style="margin-top: 120px">
        <p>Most Mennonites came for the cheap, abundant land to farm on</p>
        <p>|<br>|<br>V</p>
        <p>Many others became teachers, as my grandfather and his uncles did</p>
        <p>|<br>|<br>V</p>
        <p>Relatively small number of Mennonites came in total, so not a huge impact, but other German immigrants did</p>
        <p>|<br>|<br>V</p>
        <p>Many Germans came to start businesses - had an easier time doing this because there was already a strong German immigrant base built up in Canada</p>
        <p>|<br>|<br>V</p>
        <p>Since some German families date back hundreds of years, they were part of the general confederation of Canada that had a negative impact on Indigenous population</p>
